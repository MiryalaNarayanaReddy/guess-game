## about

1. When you run the program it asks you for the range and then it selects a number randomly from 1 to the number you  gave as range.

2. The game is you have to guess the number (some hint will be given if your answer is wrong).

3. your highscore will be updated (depending on highscore that is already there and  present score).

Note: It will be interesting though this is ```not``` using any ```graphical interfaces```.
